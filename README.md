## Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with NLP Model

Implemented a Machine Learning (ML)-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to perform sentiment analysis on online movie reviews using the Stanford 50k IMDB Movie Review dataset. Initially developed a custom NLP model, then fine-tuned the HuggingFace "Twitter > Roberta Base Sentiment" model for efficiency and accuracy in handling colloquial language. Processed data included the removal of web elements and handling of contractions and stop words for effective tokenization.
